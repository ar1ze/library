# Library

A simple library application to keep track of books you've read. Users can add new books to a visual bookshelf, remove them, and toggle their read status. This project is part of [The Odin Project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library), focusing on object-oriented principles.
